# Carbon Footprint Plugin for SimGrid

This repository contains documentation and tutorials on how to use the **Carbon Footprint Plugin** in Batsim, a plugin developed to simulate and monitor COâ‚‚ emissions associated with energy consumption of computational hosts in distributed systems.

The functional plugin code is available at: https://github.com/saraiva03/simgrid/tree/carbon-footprint-calc. The `host_carbon_footprint.cpp` file here is for reference/illustration only.

## ðŸš€ Installation and Configuration

### 1. Download SimGrid
```bash
# Clone the SimGrid fork with carbon footprint modifications
git clone https://github.com/saraiva03/simgrid/tree/carbon-footprint-calc
cd simgrid
```

### 2. Download Batsim
```bash
# Clone the Batsim fork with carbon footprint modifications
git clone https://github.com/saraiva03/batsim/tree/carbon-footprint-calc
cd batsim
```

**Compilation**: Build instructions are available in the official documentation of SimGrid and Batsim simulators.

## ðŸ§ª Running Simulations

### In Batsim
```bash
# Start Batsim
batsim -p platforms/platform.xml -w workloads/workload.json --carbon-footprint
